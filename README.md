Welcome to the Fantasy Football Flatiron application

# Setup
Fork and clone this repository from github and do '''bundle install'''

# Ruby Version
We are using '''Ruby Version 2.6.1''' for our application

# System Dependencies
This app uses '''Sqlite3''' as database.
Bundler gem is already installed so running bundle install would install rails and all its dependencies.
Additionally gem'bcrypt', gem 'fantasy_football_nerd'( for API data) and gem'csv'(for) are installed for this
